### 1. Special coloring options of plots
# In this presentation, we are going to look at 3 practical tools to make data visualization more effective.
```{r}

ggplot(df) +
  geom_point(aes(x = weight, y = height, color = age), size = 3)+
  theme_classic()+
  scale_color_gradient(low = "orange", high = "blue")


```

### 2. Adding Legends to plots
